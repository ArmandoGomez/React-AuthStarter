# Reactjs with Firebase Authentication

> A live demo of the project is found [here](https://react-firebase-authentication.herokuapp.com/).

This a simple Reactjs project showcasing use of firebase authentication. It has both public and private endpoints. Private endpoints are protected using session handling.

For users that signs in through email/password in the website, it is also possible to make password modifications (like reset or change password). For users that signs in using Facebook, this feature is disabled.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Some Endpoints

- `/`: it's the root route, also called the landing page.
- `/signin`: where the user is able to login either through Facebook or via email/password
- `/signup`: where the user can signup using email/password.
- `/account`: protected endpoint, available only for users registered using email/password. At this endpoint, they can modify/reset their password.
- `/home`: protected endpoint, reachable only for authenticated users.

## How to run

Do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/psatler/react-firebase-authentication.git
cd react-firebase-authentication
npm start
```

## How to Deploy

Make sure you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed. Then, just follow [this](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack#quick-start) instructions.

Remember to add your new domain to the Firebase Console: firebase console -> Authentication -> Sign-in Method Tab -> Authorized Domains Section (at the bottom of the page)

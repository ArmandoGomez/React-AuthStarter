//this config is being used for both development and production environment. Though, it is a best practice creating a second project and have two configs: one for production (prodConfig) and another for development (devConfig), so you choose the config based on the environment.

const config = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: ""
};

if (!firebase.apps.length) {
    //initializing with the config object
    firebase.initializeApp(config);
}

//separting database API and authentication
const db = firebase.database();
const auth = firebase.auth();

const facebookProvider = new firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider();

export { db, auth, facebookProvider };
